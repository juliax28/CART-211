                        <p> Hey everyone, moderator Ebony here. </p>
                        <p> I just wanted to make a quick announcement! Nothing serious, tho, don't get your pants in a
                            knot (is that the expression? IDK XD) </p>
                        <p> Julie told me to get on here and tell you guys that she's going to be taking a break from
                            being Admin for a while due to having to deal with some stuff. But don't worry, we aren't
                            pausing any activties because of it. She's still working on scanning magazines, and I'm
                            still uploading them. We are also going to still be doing the raffle for the MagAzine
                            tickets.
                            Buut Julie passed over the responsiblities of the concert meetup to me and Kitty, so
                            plsplspls if you have any questions send US emails. (Bummer for her, she won't be going.
                            T_T)
                            Anyway, that's all! BYEE
